# DSA Visualization Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based visualization tool for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It allows users to see how algorithms work step-by-step, with visual representations of the data and highlighted code execution.

The first algorithm implemented is QuickSort, which demonstrates:
- Pivot selection
- Partitioning
- Recursive sorting
- Element swapping

## Key Features

1. **Interactive Array Visualization**:
   - Color-coded elements showing the current state
   - Visual indicators for pivot, pointers, and swapped elements
   - Animated transitions between steps

2. **Code Highlighting**:
   - Syntax-highlighted code display
   - Current line highlighting synchronized with the visualization
   - Clear representation of the algorithm's logic

3. **Step Control**:
   - Play/pause automatic execution
   - Step forward/backward manually
   - Speed control for the animation
   - Reset functionality

4. **Customization**:
   - Adjustable array size
   - Random array generation

## Technical Implementation

The application is built using:
- **React** with **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Styled Components** for styling
- Custom algorithm implementations with step tracking

The architecture separates:
- Algorithm logic (in `src/algorithms/`)
- Visualization components (in `src/components/`)
- Application structure (in `src/App.tsx`)

## How to Run the Project

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js (v14 or later)
   - npm or yarn

2. **Setup**:
   ```
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install styled-components
   npm install styled-components @types/styled-components
   
   # Start the development server
   npm start
   ```

3. **Usage**:
   - Open browser at `http://localhost:3000`
   - Generate a random array
   - Start the sorting visualization
   - Use controls to navigate through the algorithm execution

## Future Development

This project can be extended by:
1. Adding more sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.)
2. Implementing data structure visualizations (Trees, Linked Lists, etc.)
3. Adding graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)
4. Enhancing the UI with more customization options
5. Adding performance metrics and complexity analysis

## Learning Value

This visualization tool helps users:
- Understand how algorithms work internally
- See the step-by-step execution process
- Connect code with its visual representation
- Learn about time and space complexity through observation
